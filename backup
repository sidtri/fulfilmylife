Did you know that it takes atleast 20 minutes for signals to get from your stomach to your brain to tell you that you are full.\r\n\r\nI know you are busy and it might not be possible for you to allocate time, but there is no other way except to make time for yourself and eat slowly and consciously.\r\n\r\nBecause, eating slowly is the base and acts like a foundation for changing your diet or what ever it is you want to do in order to get lean and be healthy.\r\n\r\nWhat to do today\r\nOnce you felt you ate slowly today, say yes below.\r\n\r\n	2018-02-05 16:43:46.062861	2018-02-06 16:51:38.820291	1	eat-slow	\N	<p>Did you know that it takes atleast 20 minutes for signals to get from your stomach to your brain to tell you that you are full.</p>\r\n<p>I know you are busy and it might not be possible for you to allocate time, but there is no other way except to make time for yourself and eat slowly and consciously.</p>\r\n<p>Because, eating slowly is the base and acts like a foundation for changing your diet or what ever it is you want to do in order to get lean and be healthy.</p>\r\n<p>What to do today\r\nOnce you felt you ate slowly today, say yes below.</p>\r\n	14	1	\N
6	PAY ATTENTION	WHY YOU SHOULD EAT SLOWLY ?		Here, we've been talking about why it's important to slow down, relax, and pay attention — and how this apparently simple change can eventually have big results.\r\n\r\nToday, we're going to give you a slightly wacky suggestion:\r\n\r\nIf you overeat, do it slowly.\r\n\r\n(Trust us. This sounds crazy, but it works.)\r\n\r\nMore speed, less control\r\nWhether it's garden-variety overeating (as in "Ma! No more pasta! OK, maybe a little"); distracted eating ("Oops! Did I finish that entire bag of chips while watching Breaking Bad?"); or binge eating ("I totally lost control"), many folks struggle with their food choices sometimes.\r\n\r\nIt's normal.\r\n\r\n(How do you think we know so much about this stuff? Let’s just say we... ahem... have done some “hands-on research” of our own.)\r\n\r\nEver notice what overeating episodes and/or poor food choices tend to have in common?\r\n\r\nSpeed.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever been through a classic binge, you know what we're talking about. It's like going on autopilot.\r\n\r\nHand, mouth, hand, mouth, hand, mouth.\r\n\r\nPicking up speed as you go, faster and faster and faster.\r\n\r\nOnce you get serious momentum, it feels almost impossible to stop.\r\n\r\nAnd right now, if you're struggling with binge eating, we won't ask you to stop.\r\n\r\nOvereating does something important and valuable for you.\r\n\r\nRight now, overeating solves a problem for you (even if it creates other problems).\r\n\r\nSo, if this resonates with you, let's talk about another solution.\r\n\r\n(If you don't struggle with overeating, that's cool. Skip today's lesson, keep on eating slowly, and we'll see you back in class tomorrow.)\r\n\r\nInstead of "don't overeat", overeat slowly.\r\n\r\nWait... what?\r\n\r\nOvereat slowly\r\nThink about it.\r\n\r\nWhat's the Opposite Day for binge eating, where you cram down a lot of food as fast as possible?\r\n\r\nEating slowly.\r\n\r\nYou can still binge.\r\n\r\nEat as much as you want. Eat whatever you want. (We'll worry about changing this later. For now, one thing at a time.)\r\n\r\nYes. You have our permission and you read that correctly: If you are in the throes of a compulsive eating episode, eat as much as you need to — and whatever types of foods you want — in order to make yourself feel better.\r\n\r\nEat until you're done.\r\n\r\nThe only catch is that you eat slowly.\r\n\r\nWait... isn't that irresponsible?\r\nWell, if you're like most folks who have grappled with overeating, you've tried to "just stop".\r\n\r\nYou've tried to talk yourself out of it. You've felt guilty, regretful, and ashamed.\r\n\r\nDid it work?\r\n\r\nProbably not so well.\r\n\r\nSo in fact, the most "responsible" thing is to learn to be present with your eating, instead of zoning out.\r\n\r\nYou do that by slowing down.\r\n\r\nOne thing at a time\r\nRight now, overeating does something for you. It's a way to cope. We're not going to take that away from you if you need it.\r\n\r\nAll we're going to do is change one small thing at a time.\r\n\r\nWhatever you eat, whenever you eat, no matter how crazy or epic the eating episode becomes... just do it slowly.\r\n\r\nYou can eat everything you want. As much as you want.\r\n\r\nAs long as you do it one mindful bite, one deep breath, one pause to savor, at a time.\r\n\r\nHey, you want that food. You might as well truly enjoy it.\r\n\r\nMake like a turtle. Sloooow downnn.\r\n\r\nWhat to do today\r\nEat slowly.\r\nAt every meal, try to take a few extra minutes. Put your utensils down. Take a breath or two between bites. Notice tastes and textures. Enjoy and savor your food.\r\n\r\nOvereat slowly.\r\nIf you need to overeat or binge to feel better right now, no problem. You have our permission to eat whatever you want, as much as you want.\r\n\r\nThe only catch is that you must do it as slowly as possible.\r\n\r\nHang in there.\r\nIf you're struggling with overeating, it may seem like there's no end in sight. Be patient and persistent.\r\n\r\nWe've helped thousands of people change their behaviors for good. It just takes time and practice.\r\n\r\nIf you're here, it means that at least part of you wants to change. All you have to do is keep showing up.	2018-02-05 16:45:48.701516	2018-02-06 16:52:02.314811	0	pay-attention	\N	<p>Here, we've been talking about why it's important to slow down, relax, and pay attention — and how this apparently simple change can eventually have big results.</p>\r\n<p>Today, we're going to give you a slightly wacky suggestion:</p>\r\n<p>If you overeat, do it slowly.</p>\r\n<p>(Trust us.

Reflect on a river that flows downstream … imagine wishing it would flow upstream. It would just bring you unhappiness to wish that the river were different than it were. Now imagine that this other person is the river. Wishing they were different just brings unhappiness.\r\n3. See them as they are and open your heart to them, just as they are.

17	VRIN SCORE	Lets see your website is worth it		You have to grow your social media. A lot of people approach this from the wrong direction. To grow your social media following, you need to understand VRIN scores. V stands for value. R stands for rarity or how rare it is. I stands for inimitable and N stands for non-substitutable.\r\n \r\nValue means you are giving your followers what they are interested in. Your posts need to be reaching your audience's values. I know my audience values the good life, so I give them content that shows what success brings with it. People value the payoff of hard work and entrepreneurship, so I post my cars, my house and all the great things that my businesses have allowed me to buy.\r\n \r\nRarity is how many other accounts are out there posting similar content. The more content that you provide that not many people get to see, the more excited people will be when they see it. It’s common sense. Rarity is the amount of emotion that people get when they see your post.\r\n \r\nInimitable means your post is hard to recreate. It means that not only is it rare, it’s extremely unique and genuine. People can tell when what you’re posting is trying to be like someone else. You have to be unique, so others can’t reproduce what you’ve created.\r\n \r\nNon-substitutable is similar to rarity, but it also means that what your posting is relatively impossible to be replaced by something new. You need to create timeless content, so as time goes on, your post is still relevant.	2018-03-12 09:58:35.511571	2018-03-12 09:58:35.511571	1	vrin-score	\N	<p>You have to grow your social media.

You have to be unique, so others can’t reproduce what you’ve created.</p>\r\n<p>Non-substitutable is similar to rarity, but it also means that what your posting is relatively impossible to be replaced by something new. You need to create timeless content, so as time goes on, your post is still relevant.</p>\r\n	\N	\N	6

The reason is that it takes about 20 minutes for our brains to register that we’re full. If we eat fast, we can continue eating past the point where we’re full. If we eat slowly, we have time to realize we’re full, and stop on time. Now, I would still recommend that you eat healthier foods, but if you’re looking to lose weight, eating slowly should be a part of your new lifestyle.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Enjoy your food</strong>. This reason is just as powerful, in my opinion. It’s hard to enjoy your food if it goes by too quickly. In fact, I think it’s fine to eat sinful foods, if you eat a small amount slowly. Think about it: you want to eat sinful foods (desserts, fried foods, pizza, etc.) because they taste good. But if you eat them fast, what’s the point? If you eat them slowly, you can get the same amount of great taste, but with less going into your stomach. That’s math that works for me. And that argument aside, I think you are just happier by tasting great food and enjoying it fully, by eating slowly. Make your meals a gastronomic pleasure, not a thing you do rushed, between stressful events.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Better digestion</strong>. If you eat slower, you’ll chew your food better, which leads to better digestion. Digestion actually starts in the mouth, so the more work you do up there, the less you’ll have to do in your stomach. This can help lead to fewer digestive problems.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Less stress</strong>. Eating slowly, and paying attention to our eating, can be a great form of <a href="https://zenhabits.net/2007/07/5-inspirations-for-being-in-the-moment/">mindfulness exercise</a>. Be in the moment, rather than rushing through a meal thinking about what you need to do next. When you eat, you should eat. This kind of mindfulness, I believe, will lead to a less stressful life, and long-term happiness. Give it a try.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Rebel against fast food and fast life</strong>. Our hectic, fast-paced, stressful, chaotic lives — the Fast Life — leads to eating Fast Food, and eating it quickly. This is a lifestyle that is dehumanizing us, making us unhealthy, stressed out, and unhappy. We rush through our day, doing one mindless task after another, without taking the time to live life, to enjoy life, to relate to each other, to be human. That’s not a good thing in my book. Instead, rebel against that entire lifestyle and philosophy … with the small act of eating slower. Don’t eat Fast Food. Eat at a good restaurant, or better yet, cook your own food and enjoy it fully.

33	Notice and name	One secret to a lean and healthy body: Paying attention.		Today, we're going to give you a ridiculously simple and easy — but potentially powerful — tool.\r\n\r\nIt's not a diet or workout trick. It's a brain trick.\r\n\r\nWe call it "notice and name".\r\n\r\nYup, it's just that basic. Stay with us here.\r\n\r\n__What's going on?__\r\n\r\nWhat are you doing ... right now?\r\n\r\nWhat are you thinking ... right now?\r\n\r\nWhat's around you ... right now?\r\n\r\nIf you're like most people, you're probably not completely sure.\r\n\r\nYou might be trying to answer an email while listening to music or talking on the phone or, heaven forbid, driving. You're probably kinda checked out most of the time, trying to multi-task and juggle all the demands on your attention.\r\n\r\nOur brain makes thousands of small decisions every day. Most of them are automatic and unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe upside is that we can repeat patterns — like driving, tying our shoelaces, and brushing our teeth.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that we can repeat patterns — like mindless munching, using booze or junk food to de-stress, or grabbing another round of take-out for another rushed lunch break.\r\n\r\nWe don't make bad food decisions because we're dumb or lazy. (In fact, if you're still here, you're obviously smart and willing to work hard.)\r\n\r\nWe make bad food decisions because they're automatic. Because we're distracted. Because we're rushing and busy. Because we're human, just trying to get through another day.\r\n\r\nAnd automatic choices minus attention plus rushed eating and busy-ness usually equals over-eating crap or skipping meals.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there's a simple solution: Notice and name.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Notice and name__\r\n\r\nNoticing just means pausing to pay attention.\r\n\r\nWhat's going on right now? What am I doing?\r\n\r\nNaming just means you take an extra moment to describe the situation to yourself. Call it out.\r\n\r\nOh, right, I'm feeling rushed, and that means I'm more likely to grab junk.\r\n\r\n\r\n__How the heck does that help me?__\r\n\r\nWhen we slow down, pause, and pay attention, we put our conscious, thinky brain in charge instead of our unconscious, automatic brain.\r\n\r\nWe're able to make more informed choices. Like picking healthy food.\r\n\r\nWe feel more in control of our actions — more able to do those behavior goals we've set for ourselves. We're calmer.\r\n\r\nWe notice little things, like the way we're rushing through a meal.\r\n\r\nWe place our attention on our goals, rather than having it pulled.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when we name the situation, we call it out. Hold ourselves accountable, without judgement. Just observation.\r\n\r\nDude, you're doing that thing again.\r\n\r\nOops. Right.\r\n\r\nNoticing that.\r\n\r\nOK, I'm taking a second to regroup.\r\n\r\nBack on track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__Try a 5-minute "notice and name" today__\r\n\r\nToday, do a little noticing and naming.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re making a sandwich, or just getting on with your day, set aside 5 minutes to just… pay attention.\r\n\r\nWhat are your patterns?\r\n\r\nWhat do you "just find yourself" doing?\r\n\r\nWhat's happening right now?\r\n\r\nWhat's distracting you — and how can you re-focus on your goals?\r\n\r\nHow does that sandwich taste? What's the texture like?

Don’t worry! I’ll meet you where you are and guide you on your path).\r\nDisarm the negative voice in your head that’s been sabotaging your weight loss efforts and holding you back in all areas of your life.\r\nSet yourself up for a series of small (but essential) victories that will create the momentum you need to complete and sustain your weight loss goals!\r\n \r\nPhase 2: Thinking Yourself Thin\r\nIdentify and eliminate perfectionism because none of us are perfect, and beating ourselves up for not being so is a recipe for disaster. It’s perfectionism that leads to weight gain and poor self-esteem. So we’ll kick it to the curb!\r\nIdentify and eliminate blocks and create the mindset needed to lose weight and feel amazing for your whole life.\r\nCreate quick and easy rituals that jump-start your metabolism and energy every single day for maximum results.\r\n \r\nPhase 3: Building the Food Framework:\r\nCreate and follow a real-food plan designed to make healthy eating simple, and automatic (without being based on sacrifice or requiring ingredients that no real kitchen actually has!)\r\nHelp you become a mindful eater so you can stop eating when you’re physically satisfied and establish healthy portion control. You’ll learn your own “body language”- the messages your body sends and how to interpret them.\r\nLearn how to identify the difference between physical hunger and emotional hunger.\r\n \r\nPhase 4: Developing the Exercise Plan:\r\nChoose the right exercise plan for you that fits into your busy schedule.\r\nSTOP thinking you need to spend hours at the gym. You’ll be shocked at how easy this really is and how little is actually required.\r\nImplement a fun and do-able exercise plan that you’ll actually stick to! This is about designing a plan that doesn’t feel like work and is a seamless addition to your current schedule and lifestyle.\r\n \r\nPhase 5: Staying on Track\r\nDive deep to uncover the root causes of emotional eating and diet “relapse.”\r\nIncorporate planned indulgences into your otherwise healthy diet, instead of depriving yourself (which we all know doesn’t work long-term).\r\nGet into your grocery groove! Ensuring that your shopping habits don’t get in the way of your weight loss.\r\nPhase 6: Living in Your Dream Bod!\r\nIdentify the people in your life that will support you in maintaining your new, healthy, and empowered life!\r\nImplement follow-through strategies to support you in all aspects of your life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr walsh fat is not your fault\r\n1) Cortisol\r\nWhy someone may "hypothelamus" - appetite, talks with petutary gland\r\n* (told from crh) adrenal gland - through acth (with receptor) from hypothelamus. hypothelamus receives signal from neurotransmitter, immune system, molecules & harmones low cortisol -> means adrenal glands are told to not make cortisol. (hypothelamus through crh sends signal pituatary gland -> acth from pituatary glad to adrenal gland)If pituatary gland not functioning properly then pituatary gland cant send signal to adrenals\r\n* Adsense disease (autoimmune condition that sophs cortisol). Kushine(Autoimmune condition that enhances cortisol at adrenal glands)\r\n* Waking up at night, cravings for sugar -cortisol evaluation\r\n* Cholesterol : Adrenal glands takes cholesterol and with some conversions (Pregmentalone(projesterone(aldestrone, cortisol), dhea(andro(testosterone(estragen, diht))))(is limited) - enzyme)\r\n* pregnetalone can be converted more into cortisol and leads to dhea enzymes low.(sex harmones low)\r\n* Adrenal glands has receptors for interlucin 6 which might signals adrenalin glands to signal raise cortisol\r\n* if DHEA is low cortisol is high then pregnetalone goes left side more.\r\n*\r\n- Cortisol goes from high to low (cortisol sardium level) from morning to evening\r\n- melatonin goes from low to high which is inverse of cortisol.\r\n\r\nHow to check if cortisol ?\r\n - Symptoms (forms)\r\n - Salavary harmone test profile (Free cortisol test) \r\n[ All day cortisol low = blood sugar issues & hard time getting out of bed ,\r\n  All day cortisol high = blood sugar issues & hard time sleeping at night & easily get out of bed but feels not having enough sleep at night,\r\n  Altered circadian rhythm = high at night .

Don’t worry! I’ll meet you where you are and guide you on your path).\r\nDisarm the negative voice in your head that’s been sabotaging your weight loss efforts and holding you back in all areas of your life.\r\nSet yourself up for a series of small (but essential) victories that will create the momentum you need to complete and sustain your weight loss goals!</p>\r\n<p>Phase 2: Thinking Yourself Thin\r\nIdentify and eliminate perfectionism because none of us are perfect, and beating ourselves up for not being so is a recipe for disaster. It’s perfectionism that leads to weight gain and poor self-esteem. So we’ll kick it to the curb!\r\nIdentify and eliminate blocks and create the mindset needed to lose weight and feel amazing for your whole life.\r\nCreate quick and easy rituals that jump-start your metabolism and energy every single day for maximum results.</p>\r\n<p>Phase 3: Building the Food Framework:\r\nCreate and follow a real-food plan designed to make healthy eating simple, and automatic (without being based on sacrifice or requiring ingredients that no real kitchen actually has!)\r\nHelp you become a mindful eater so you can stop eating when you’re physically satisfied and establish healthy portion control. You’ll learn your own “body language”- the messages your body sends and how to interpret them.\r\nLearn how to identify the difference between physical hunger and emotional hunger.</p>\r\n<p>Phase 4: Developing the Exercise Plan:\r\nChoose the right exercise plan for you that fits into your busy schedule.\r\nSTOP thinking you need to spend hours at the gym. You’ll be shocked at how easy this really is and how little is actually required.\r\nImplement a fun and do-able exercise plan that you’ll actually stick to! This is about designing a plan that doesn’t feel like work and is a seamless addition to your current schedule and lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p>Phase 5: Staying on Track\r\nDive deep to uncover the root causes of emotional eating and diet “relapse.”\r\nIncorporate planned indulgences into your otherwise healthy diet, instead of depriving yourself (which we all know doesn’t work long-term).\r\nGet into your grocery groove! Ensuring that your shopping habits don’t get in the way of your weight loss.\r\nPhase 6: Living in Your Dream Bod!\r\nIdentify the people in your life that will support you in maintaining your new, healthy, and empowered life!\r\nImplement follow-through strategies to support you in all aspects of your life.</p>\r\n<p>Dr walsh fat is not your fault\r\n1) Cortisol\r\nWhy someone may "hypothelamus" - appetite, talks with petutary gland</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(told from crh) adrenal gland - through acth (with receptor) from hypothelamus. hypothelamus receives signal from neurotransmitter, immune system, molecules &amp; harmones low cortisol -&gt; means adrenal glands are told to not make cortisol.
